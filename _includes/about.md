### Hello, I'm **Jeremy Roman**.

I am a Computer Science Student at the [University of Waterloo][uwaterloo].

I'm involved with the [Computer Science Club][csclub], where I'm on the
Systems Committee. You might see my fingerprints on things like the
[mirror maintenance stuff][mirror.git] and [ceo][pyceo.git]. In short, I
help keep things working.

Most of my personal code is [Ruby][ruby] or [Python][python], but I
learn new languages all the time.
